She was only teasing. Penny loved pizza! After all, her family owned Pizzarelli’s Pizza Parlor.\n\n“Pizza time!” Pete shouted. He ran past Penny. She sighed. \n\nDo little brothers have to get excited about everything?  she thought. At least he can’t be nine forever!\n\nTheir dad laughed as they followed him through the kitchen and into the restaurant.\n\n“Don’t we get a puzzle with our pizza?” Pete asked. He loved pizza, but he loved puzzles just as much. Maybe more!\n\nMrs. Pizzarelli shook her head. She was tall and blond. Penny, who was eleven, looked like her. Pete was short and dark-haired like their father. “Pete, you sure take after your great-great-grandpapa. Papa Pietro loved his puzzles!”\n\nThe End!",
