Her charm bracelet sits comfortably on her wrist bone, wavering solemnly in the western breeze.  Khhha - she clears her throat gingerly, releasing a wizard’s puff of smoke into the air around her nose. Far below, she can sense the dew slipping hesitantly down a ridge of honeysuckle. The smell is sweet to her, stuck and stalking through the thick fog, rising to the warmer air above.</p><p>“Don’t listen,” she mutters, saying a silent prayer with her toes and fingernails. The bones in her collar quiver, delicate and uncommonly confident. Jacob holds an uncanny resemblance to her little sister; little in age and stature, but most certainly born first, in the way of the old rites. This would not often occur to her, but in such a moment as this one the mind is fragile and wavering, grasping for distant belongings.</p>",
